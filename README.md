# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict math scores based on various input features such as writing scores, reading scores, and demographic information. The pipeline includes data ingestion, transformation, model training, and prediction functionalities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml_project.git
   cd ml_project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
conda create -n ml_project_env python=3.8 -y
conda activate ml_project_env
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python src/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
```
This will ingest the data, preprocess it, train the models, and save the best-performing model and preprocessor.

### Making Predictions
To make predictions with the trained model, you can use the predict_pipeline.py. Here's how you can run it:
```bash
python src/pipeline/predict_pipeline.py
```
Ensure you provide the required input features through your web application or command line.

## Logging
Logs are stored in the logs directory, which is created automatically. The log files are named with timestamps for easy tracking.

## Exception Handling
Custom exceptions are defined in exception.py to provide meaningful error messages throughout the application.
